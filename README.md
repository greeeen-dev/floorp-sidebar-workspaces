# Panel Sidebar Workspaces for Floorp 12
A standalone mod derived from [Natsumi Browser](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/natsumi-browser) that reimplements
Workspaces management to Floorp's Panel Sidebar to Floorp 12, just like in Floorp 11.

While Natsumi is licensed under GPLv3, this part of Natsumi has been licensed under MIT for easier integration to
existing projects.

[fx-autoconfig](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig) is required to use this.
